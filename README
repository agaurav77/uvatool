UVATOOL

uvatool is an attempt at reconstructing the way I do competitive programming stuff. Currently, the workflow is like

(1) Read a Problem in Browser
(2) Simultaneously think / code in vim
(3) Compile and Debug
(4) Submit in Browser, and loop back to (1) or (2)

If uvatool is completed, the workflow I'll achieve would be

(1) Read a problem in Browser or terminal (without images)
(2) Simultaneously think / code in vim
(3) Compile and Debug
(4) Submit via terminal using uvatool, and loop back to (1) or (2)

Still in progress.
